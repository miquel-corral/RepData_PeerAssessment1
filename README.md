## Introduction

This file is intended to explain the files submitted to fullfill the Peer Assignment 1 of the Reproducible Research module in the Data Science specialization course.

### Structure of the repo

The repository maintains the same structure and all the files of the original repo. 

There is a new folder called *test* to allocate test files of R code used to resolve the assignment while developing the final report. 

There is a new folder called *PA1_template_files* to allocate the image files generated to be included in the final report.

### Files

The new files added in the final submission are:
- activity.csv: .csv data file extracted from the file activity.zip.  
- test/test.R: R code file with R code used to resolve the assignment. This code can be different from the one included in the final version of the report submitted.
